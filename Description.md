My project will be a program simulating buying a used car. The program will use files to store information organizing cars by their body type and year. 
The program will ask a series of questions using cout and cin statements to see what kind of car the person wants to buy as well as display the cost of 
the certain car they wish to buy. This will use data types such as string, int, const, and char, as well as control structures to efficiently cycle through 
car categories and questions about the userâ€™s intentions.
